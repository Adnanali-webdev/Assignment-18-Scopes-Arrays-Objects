2. The following is an array of 10 students ages:


    => const ages = [19, 22, 19, 24, 20, 25, 26, 24, 25, 24O]
L     Sort the array and find the min and max age1
L     Find the median age(one middle item or two middle items divided by twom
L     Find the average age(all items divided by number of itemsm
L     Find the range of the ages(max minus minm
L     Compare the value of (min - average) and (max - average), use abs() method
 

3. Object Extensibility and Sealing


a) Use the Object.preventExtensions method to prevent any further additions of properties to the student object.

b) Use the Object.isExtensible method to check if the student object is extensible. Store the result in a variable
called extensibleStatus.

c) Create a new object called teacher with a 'subject' property set to 'Math'.

d) Use the Object.seal method to seal the teacher object, preventing any additions or deletions of properties.

e) Use the Object.isSealed method to check if the teacher object is sealed. Store the result in a variable called
sealedStatus.

f) Print the extensibleStatus and sealedStatus to the console.


4. Assignment: Building a Student Management System


Description:

You are tasked with building a student management system using JavaScript. The system should allow you to
perform various operations on a list of students, including adding, updating, deleting, and displaying student
information.


Requirements:

Here is an initial array of students. Each student is represented as an object with the following properties: id,
firstName, lastName, age, and grade.

const students = [

  { id: 1, firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 20, grade:
"A" },

  { id: 2, firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Smith", age: 22, grade:
"B" },

  { id: 3, firstName: "Bob", lastName: "Johnson", age: 19, grade:
"A" },

  // Add more students as needed

a. Add a Student: Create a function to add a new student to the array.

b. Update Student Information: Create a function to update a student's information based on their id.

c. Delete a Student: Create a function to delete a student based on their id.

d. List All Students: Create a function to display a list of all students.

e. Find Students by Grade: Create a function to find all students who have a specific grade.

f. Calculate Average Age: Create a function to calculate the average age of all students using array method.


5. You are given a JavaScript object representing a student's information. Your task is to use the 'for...in' loop
to iterate over the properties of the object and perform various operations.

a) Create a function displayStudentInfo that takes the student object as a parameter. Inside this function, use a
'for...in' loop to iterate over the properties of the student object and print each property and its corresponding
value to the console. The output should look something like this:
const student = {

  name: "Alice",

  age: 22,

  major: "Computer Science",

  GPA: 3.8,

  isEnrolled: true

};

Property: name, Value: Alice

Property: age, Value: 22

Property: major, Value: Computer Science

Property: GPA, Value: 3.8

Property: isEnrolled, Value: true
